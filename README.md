## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a full-stack developer building modern web applications using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. This space features a variety of projects that showcase my approach to full-stack developmentâ€”focused on clean architecture, user experience, and efficient data handling.

On the front end, I work with React to create dynamic, component-based user interfaces. I use modern tools like React Router, Context API, and custom hooks to build scalable applications with intuitive navigation and responsive design. My goal is to ensure every interface is not only functional but also engaging and accessible across devices.

The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, where I design and build RESTful APIs that handle application logic, data processing, and integration with external services. I focus on writing modular and secure code, implementing features like authentication, validation, and error handling to support reliable and maintainable server-side applications.

PostgreSQL serves as the database layer, where I design efficient, normalized schemas and use SQL to manage data storage and retrieval. I also work with ORMs like Sequelize or Knex to connect the database to the application and ensure data integrity throughout the stack.

This repository contains full-stack projects, reusable components, and backend services that reflect real-world functionalityâ€”such as user registration systems, dashboards, content management tools, and more. Each project emphasizes practical, end-to-end problem-solving with a focus on performance and maintainability.

Iâ€™m passionate about building applications that are not only technically solid but also provide real value to users. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through thoughtful code and design.

Feel free to explore the projects, leave feedback, or reach out to collaborate. Iâ€™m always open to learning, iterating, and contributing to exciting web development challenges.
